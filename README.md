# Hello World! 👋 


I'm all into Data Science with a passion for learning, I most enjoy Data Visualizations and 
generative artwork.

Working with data is the 21 Century gold mining, there's so much out there waiting to be
explored! 

Many of my repositories are split between Python code and R which is the language that I 
love most. My R repos are #TidyTuesday weekly submissions and my ongoing learning in the
language of R.
